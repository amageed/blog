### About Me

My name is Ahmad Mageed, and I'm a Software Engineer in Silicon Valley (San Francisco Bay Area). **This blog, the content and views expressed herein are my own and do not represent the thoughts, opinions, intentions, plans, or strategies of my employer.**

This blog serves as my little corner of the web where I share my thoughts and experiences in the software industry.

Up until recently my bread and butter platform has been with Microsoft .NET, C#, and ASP.NET MVC. Nowadays I'm still focused on web development (full-stack) and try to stay up to date with relatively modern open source platforms, frameworks and libraries.

In my spare time I try to strike a healthy balance between mountain biking, casually playing games (XBOX), improving my Arabic, reading books, and hanging out with my lovely wife and son.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amageed), [GitHub](https://github.com/amageed), and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/59111/ahmad-mageed).

### Why Software Ninjaneer?

The name behind my site is easily explained by the following formula:

**Software + (Engineer * Ninja) = Software Ninjaneer**

This can be mathematically proven, but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Ninjas are awesome and require a high degree of discipline and practice to acquire their skills. I also happen to be a black-belt in [To Shin Do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To-Shin_Do).
