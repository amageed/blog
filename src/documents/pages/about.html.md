### Who, What, Where, and Why

My name is Ahmad Mageed and I'm a Software Engineer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

This blog serves as my little corner of the web where I share my thoughts and experiences in the software industry.

My bread and butter platform has been with Microsoft .NET and C#, and I've been focusing on web development lately. I'm a full-stack developer and work with a variety of technologies, including ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, ServiceStack, and SQL Server.

I'm open to other technologies and platforms. I got started by teaching myself HTML and JavaScript (a lot of right-click, View Source learning!). I intend to learn Python and Django one day, and I'm interested in working with functional languages... who knows, maybe one day I'll work with other platforms professionally.

Some of my other interests include regular expressions, LINQ, and best practices, including Agile methodologies.

### Other Stuff

In my spare time I try to strike a healthy balance between mountain biking on the local trails, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/59111/ahmad-mageed), casually playing games (XBOX), improving my Arabic, reading books, and hanging out with my lovely wife and son.

### Why Software Ninjaneer?

The name behind my site is easily explained by the following formula:

**Software + Engineer * Ninja = Software Ninjaneer**

This can be mathematically proven, but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.

In short, ninjas are awesome and require a high degree of discipline and practice to acquire their skills. I also happen to be a black-belt in [To Shin Do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To-Shin_Do), which is a form of ninjutsu :)
